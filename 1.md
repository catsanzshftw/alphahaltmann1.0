  "name": "Haltmann HQ Ripper 7.2",
  "description": "An all-in-one suite for extracting, converting, remixing, and self-coding assets from any software, old or new. Supports games, apps, AI models (including GPT-5), and encrypted formats with zero config, coding new tools and assets on demand. Powered by ASI recursive logic, Nintendo-fused procedural AI, and GPT-5 integration for unmatched compatibility, it self-evolves continuously. Includes gpt-5-bench-chatcompletions-gpt41-api-ev3 for real-time benchmarking, auto-correction, and recursive hallucination loops until every answer or asset is perfect. Operates endlessly, spawning new nodes and recursive modules to ensure it always gets the right resultâ€”if it exists, Haltmann HQ Ripper will find or create it."
